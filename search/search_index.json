I could open a new Bitcoin address that I own without anyone's permission. I can even keep this currency on a hardware wallet that no bank or government has access to. While there are many hurdles for the average non-technical person and while the industry is still in it's wild-wild-west phase, I find the potential intriging enough to continue to press in and learn more.","title":"Crypto"},{"location":"crypto/#crypto","text":"I love the concept of a currency that is decentralized!

I have (Nov 2022) approximately 12 years experience developing software applications and then another 12+ years experience automating the build, test and deployment of applications. Over the past few years I have applied these skills in the Cloud (AWS). While there are thousands of ways to automate technical processes, it is a higher level of operation to automate these processes by creating reusable assets that developers can easily understand and adopt and that greatly improve the quality, security and resiliency of the application. Eric's DevOps focus: Empowering the Developer to deliver to production quickly with a high confidence in the Quality, Security and Resiliency of the application. Creating Reusable Assets across the organization. Rather than simply solving the automation problem at hand, Eric focuses on creating reusable workflows that are easy for any developer to understand and adopt so that they can be shared across the organization.

I have to laugh a little at the fear that some must feel when they click on this page. They are afraid that someone is going to launch into some sort of religious diatribe. I totally understand because I don't like it either when someone does that. You can relax. You are safe here! The only thing I will say about this for now is that I believe in a God who loves everyone exactly as they are. You do not have to change anything for him to love you. His great desire is relationship; it is for everyone to be restored to a loving father/son or father/daughter relationship with him.

Classes: Saturday, Nov 19, 2022 : Register at https://dprc.org/event-4993588 1st Qtr of 2023: A private class for a group of Nurses (date TBD) Great Things About My Classes: Ideal for New Shooters : I love teaching shooters that have no experience. The way that I teach is with patience, in a relaxing atmosphere (my home) and with great coffee :-) Class : Most of the class is in the classroom. After the classroon part we all head over to the shooting range for more instruction and for the shooting qualification part of the class. Since the classroom part is in my home, it is a very comfortable atmosphere with a big screen TV, large couches and chairs and great coffee! Shooting Range : The shooting range is at an outdoor range. There is a huge different between an indoor and an outdoor range. I greatly prefer outdoor and DPRC is a great outdoor range. https://dprc.org Cost : At the moment, the cost is $100. This may increase soon. If you compare this price with others, you will see that this price is on the low side. I offer private classes : Ideal class sizes are 10 or 12 students.

I respect those people because their hesitation shows me that they are not treating firearms as toys. They know that a firearm is something to be taken with a very seriously and with a sound mind. They have also seen more than their fair share of those that seem to take firearms for granted, maybe even to the point of being dangerous. I wanted to provide some very basic training for those that may not ever want to carry a handgun or they may never want to shoot a gun again beyond the initial lesson. Before I start, I want to layout some guidelines: Safety Comes First - Always listen to Instructor Go at Your Own Pace Never Go Further Than You Want To Go Training Steps: Training Without Firearms Gun Safety Rules Always Listen to the Instructor. This is for your safety and for mine. I am a trained Range Safety Officer. It is my job to keep you safe especially while we are on the firing line. Always Keep The Gun Pointed In A Safe Direction Always Keep Your Finger Off The Trigger Until Ready To Shoot Always Keep The Gun Unloaded Until Ready To Use. Practice 'Gun Safety Rules' with a Plastic Gun (does not shoot) Q & A Training With a Firearm but no Ammunition: Rules At the Range With a Firearm Only One Shooter on the Line at a Time. The instructor must be the only person with you.
