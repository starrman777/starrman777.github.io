In recent years, I have been seeing increasing attempts to control the behavior of others by governents or corporations. I have become more interested in the potential of decentralized currencies that no government or company has the ability to control. Control sounds wonderful if those in power agree with you and are in your camp but what if the controllers are not in your camp? It doesn't sounds as much fun anymore and when you are responsible for providing for your family like I am, you begin to look for consider contingency plans! I love the concept of a currency that is decentralized! I could open a new Bitcoin address that I own without anyone's permission. I can even keep this currency on a hardware wallet that no bank has access to. While there are many hurdles for the average consumer and while the industry is still in it's wild-wild-west phase wrot with many perills, I find the potential intriging enough to continue to press in and learn more.","title":"Crypto"},{"location":"crypto/#crypto","text":"I am fascinated by the technologies as well as the financial and sociological implications of Cryptocurrencies.

I have (Nov 2022) approximately 12 years experience developing software applications and then another 12+ years experience automating the build, test and deployment of applications. Over the past few years I have applied these skills in the Cloud (AWS). Developers are great at developing software but they aren't always great about delivering that software into production in ways that minimize errors. While there are thousands of ways to automate technical processes, it is a higher level of operation to automate these processes by creating reusable assets that others can easily understand and adopt and that greatly improve the quality, security and resiliency of the application.

I have to laugh a little at the fear that some must feel when they click on this page. They are afraid that someone is going to launch into some sort of religious diatribe. I totally understand because I don't like it either when someone does that. You can relax. You are safe here! The only thing I will say about this for now is that I believe in a God who loves everyone exactly as they are. You do not have to change anything for him to love you. His great desire is relationship; it is for everyone to be restored to a loving father/son or father/daughter relationship with him.

My interest in firearms began when a friend of mine and his family were attacked during a home invasion about 12 years ago. While my friend's situation ended tragically with the loss of his life, even though he was not armed, he was able to save the life of his family. At that time I had 2 little girls and a wife. One of my daughters a week earlier had spent the night at the same home where the attack occurred. I realized at that time that I had no way of protecting my family if anything like that ever happenned to us and I decided that it was not acceptable that I do nothing about it. I believe in protecting my family so I began to take many classes. Over the years I increased in knowledge and experience and as I learned, I began teaching others. I decided to get certified as a firearms instructor since I really enjoyed teaching. I have been doing this for quite a few years!
